Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of tools, methods and principles in order to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
it is important as it helps manage complexities and abstract ideas to funtional dependable software solutions.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The NATO software engineering conferece wic higlighted the growing complexities of software engineering and the need for systematic engineering processes.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
2.Introduction of object oriented programming that introduced concepts that were formalized in different languages facilitating better organization of code and improved reusability and maintainance of code.
3. Advent of agile programming methodologies that empazised collaboration, flexibility and working on customer feedback over rigid processes.

System development Life Cycle
1.Planning: Outiles a detailed plan quiding te development process.
2.Design: Provides a blueprint on how software would be built
3.Development: Building of te actualsoftware based on the design
4.Testing: Software engineers ensure the software is functional and it meets the user needs
5.Maintenance: Implementation of enancements and ensures software remains functional over time

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method is sequential and ensures that each face must be completed before moving to the next phase while agile method is iterative and flexible wit focus on delivering small working pieces of software frequently.
Waterfall would be suitable for a government agency software with strict regulatory requirements while agile would be suitable for a mobile app to ensure user feedback is acted on.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: The roles and responsibilities of a software developer include
a) Gathering and documenting requirements
b) Developing system architectures and design specifications.
c) Actual coding
d) Testing and debugging code to ensure it meets the standards
e) Updating documentation as software evolves

2.QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINNER: Identofies isssues and ensures the final products meet the expectation and functional requirements by
a) Developing software testing strategies
b) Performing tests to identify defects
c) Ensuring software performs well

2.PROJECT MANAGER: Ensures projects are completed on time within budget and to the satisfaction of te stakeholders by
a)Developing a plan for executing and managing a project
b)Allocating and managing resources
c)Ensuring effective communication wit stakeolders
d)Mitigating project risks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide developers wit crutial features like text edditing, debugging tools build automation, code navigation among others that ensure productivity, code quality and efficiency. Example, Pycharm
Version Control Systems (VCS) help in managing changes made to a code for a given project over time enabling collaboration and maintaining project stability.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Learning and adopting to new methodologies
2. Managing changes in projects that can cause delay or budget overruns.
3. Meeting deadlines while maintaining high quality and addressing emerging issues.
4. Identifying and addressing arising security issues
5. unclear or incomplete requirements that can lead to incorrect implementation.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.UNIT TESTING: Tests the individual components of code to ensure that each one is wrking correctly.
2.INTEGRATION TESTING: Tests intterractions between integrated components to identify the arrising issues when combining components.
3.SYSTEM TESTING: Tests the entire system to ensure the performance is as intended.
4.ACCEPTANCE TESTING: This test determines wheter software meets business requirements to ensure it is acceptable to the end user.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involes crafting instructions and questions to ensure better responses from the AI assistant. 
it is imortant because it reduces redundacy and ensures the excact user need is met.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague: History of computers
Improved: Describe in summary the history of computers in bullets

The second prompt is more effective beacause it will be in summed in a bullet form making it easier to understand and processed as to a prose for the entire history.
